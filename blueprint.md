# Project Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This application is a simple and visually appealing Lotto Number Generator. It allows users to generate a set of unique lottery numbers with a single click. The design is modern, clean, and responsive, providing a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design and Features

### Visual Design
*   **Layout:** A centered, single-column layout for easy use.
*   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts, with a larger, more prominent font for the generated numbers.
*   **Color Scheme:** A modern color palette with good contrast.
*   **Iconography:** A lottery or clover icon to enhance the theme.
*   **Animation:** Subtle animations on the generated numbers to make the experience more dynamic.
*   **Texture:** A subtle background texture to add a premium feel.
*   **Shadows:** Soft drop shadows on the number balls and the button to create a sense of depth.

### Features
*   **Number Generation:** Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Display:** The generated numbers are displayed in styled "lotto balls."
*   **Interactivity:** A clear "Generate Numbers" button to initiate the process.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Transform the initial "Hello World" application into a fully functional Lotto Number Generator.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Update the HTML structure to include a title, a container for the lotto numbers, and a generation button.
    2.  **Modify `style.css`:** Apply modern and visually appealing styles to all elements, including the layout, number balls, and button.
    3.  **Modify `main.js`:** Implement the JavaScript logic for generating and displaying the unique lottery numbers.
